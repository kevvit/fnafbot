A computer bot programmed to complete a difficult level in the video game Five Nights at Freddy's

*You will need to install the following libraries:*  
pip install keyboard  
pip install pyautogui  

Run the code and switch to the game. Pressing the 'o' key on the keyboard while on the title screen will start night 7, if unlocked (but not set the AI levels. You need to do that on the first run). After that, it should keep trying to beat the game. It does not stop if it successfully beats the game.

The PyAutoGUI failsafe is moving the mouse to the corner of the screen, which exits the program.

Code may need to be tweaked based on system.
